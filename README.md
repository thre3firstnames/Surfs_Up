- Based on the available temperature data, a Surf & Ice Cream business would likely be a profitable venture for most of the year. While the winter months could see a drop in ice cream sales due to tourists’ association of ice cream to summer months, the average December temperature is still **71.0°** which is still warm compared to most of the United States during December. 
- The most recent data available in the SQLite database is from 2016. More recent temperature data could give us a more accurate picture of *current* viability during the course of a year.

## Summary
In summary, a surf & ice cream shop is a perfect combination for the island of Oahu. Surfing in the late fall and winter months see some of the island’s biggest waves (along with big surfing competitions held on the island), and the warm weather in the summer months will draw crowds looking to beat the heat.
